If this is a first time install you will probabaly want to create the spotweb
mysql database. Use: Emerge --config spotweb to create it. This creates an
empty database called spotweb. You can also create a empty database manually.
The install script ran at the next step will fill the tables up.

Visit http://<host ip>/spotweb/install.php in a browser to install/configure 
spotweb. Fix the parts which aren't OK. Follow the wizard and perform the 
instructions as given by the wizard. Please pay attention when adding user or
you risk leaving the system wide open (public mode)

Note:
The spotweb config file (dbsettings.inc.php) and cache dir was created with 
default permission according to /etc/vhosts/webapp-config. If these does not 
suit you edit the file and emerge again.


== Troubleshooting ==
When a white page appears instead of your Spotweb installation, this usually
indicates an typing error in either
your ownsettings.php, dbsettings.inc.php or a configuration error in your
webserver.

Please consult your Apache's errorlog for the exact error and fix it.
