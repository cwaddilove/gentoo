# Experimental Gentoo Linux Ebuilds #

This Git repository contains experimental ebuilds for [Gentoo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org/). At this time it consists of the following ebuilds

- [sabnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/)
- [yenc](http://www.golug.it/yenc.html)
- [couchpotato](http://couchpota.to/)
- [sickbeard](http://sickbeard.com/)
- [headphones](https://github.com/rembo10/headphones)
- [maraschino](https://github.com/mrkipling/maraschino.git)
- [libcec](http://libcec.pulse-eight.com/)

sabnzbd and yenc has been forked from the [sunrise](http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/sunrise) overlay and are both created by SÃ©bastien P.

These ebuilds are also located in the Gentoo overlay soehest. To use the overlay type the following commands

```bash
emerge git layman
echo "source /var/lib/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf
layman -f
layman -a soehest
```

To install one of the ebuilds from this overlay you need to add it to /etc/portage/package.keyword  

```ruby
echo "net-nntp/sabnzbd" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
echo "net-nntp/yenc" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
emerge sabnzbd
```

More info on Gentoo Layman can be found [here](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml)

I take no responsibility if usage of these ebuilds makes your computer burn, crash, or start downloading naughty movies or country music. These builds are higly experimental. What works for me may not work for you. Now you have been warned!

As mentioned sabnzbd has been forked and quite some changes have been made. I decided to fork it as the sunrise overlay seemed to be stalled/unmaintained. After this fork the original maintainer came to life and has agreed to maintain his build so hopefully it will go live into portage soon.
